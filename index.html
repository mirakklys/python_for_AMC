	<h2>Here is the site for the AMC for Python repository</h2>
	<p>You can download the current version for <a href="python_for_AMC.py">usual Multiple Choice (0.4.0)</a>, a version for <a href="open_Qs_for_AMC.py">Open Question exam (0.2.2)</a> or <a href="https://github.com/mirakklys/python_for_AMC">go to the repository</a></p> 
<p></p><p></p>
	<h1>Auto Multiple Choice for Linux. AMC. Python-assisted source.tex creation. Only for tests with separate answer sheets!</h1>
<p>This is the automation of AMC redaction. The internal AMC-TXT should be working in a similar way, but I wanted the one that reflects my needs, if you want you can freely use it :)</p>

<p>Place both <b>python_for_AMC.py</b> file in the folder with questions you want to convert. The <b>wrongCorrect.png</b> image will be fetched into the same directory while executing <b>python_for_AMC.py</b> since 0.4.0 Version</p>

<p>The main rules:</p>
<p>1. Questions should be saved in ~~separate <b>Qs.txt</b>, <b>Qms.txt</b> or <b>Qhs.txt</b>~~ one file <b>Qs.txt</b>, file utf-8 encoded depending on the type of questions</p>
<p>2. Simple question should start with <tt>'qqq'</tt> (see the example below)</p>
<p>3. Multi correct answer questions should start with triple <tt>'qmq'</tt> (see the example below)</p>
<p>4. Horizontal answer questions should start with <tt>'qhq'</tt> (5 columns by default) or <tt>'qhN'</tt>, where N is an integer reflecting the number of columns. I decided not to use the <tt>{choiceshoriz}</tt> since this option won't align the answers left. If you have 3 and less answers (e.g. True or False) you could leave default <tt>'qhq'</tt></p>
<p>5. Correct answer starts with <tt>'+++'</tt></p>
<p>6. Wrong answer starts with <tt>'---'</tt></p>
<p>7. Please note, that 'Fifty Shades of Grey' will be omitted because they don't have a recognised prefix</p>
<p></p>
<p>So far, most of the goals I set for the project achieved (simple questions, qmq, qhq/qhN)</p>
<p>In future, the code will also process image containing questions (as <tt>'qiq'</tt>).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The example for processing will look like:</p>
<p></p>
<pre>qmqWhat is the best movie in the world?
+++Interstellar
---Harry Potter
+++Alita
---Saw
Fifty Shades of Grey

qqqWhat is the best animated film?
+++Frozen
---Barbi
---Masha and the Bear

qhqI, Robot novel was written by Isaac Asimov
+++True
---False

qh4What is our genome made of
+++DNA and proteins
---Proteins
---Lipids
---Sugars
</pre>
<p>The processed file will be in the same folder, called <b>prcssdQs.txt</b></p>
<p></p>
<h2>List of changes:</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>0.4.1</h3>
<p></p>
<p>A lot of optimisations. Changed the SheBang</p>
<p></p>
Fixed the bug with \insertgroup
<h3>0.4.0</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Now the <b>wrongCorrect.png</b> image is downloaded in the end of the process</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also added the log file creation. You will need to delete it yourself, with time it is going to take some space on your computer
<p></p>
<p>Reason for adding: in past hundreds of script executions it never failed. However, while it was a Midterm exam, the question FOR LOOP was terminated and never raised an issue. This led to incomplete test (about 20% of questions were omitted), while the rest of the script went well. I couldn't catch the error, and couldn't reproduce it, so HAIL THE LOG. If you have any issues like I mentioned, send the log to me along with your <b>Qs.txt</b> and <b>prcssdQs.txt</b>, my working email is mirakklys.gh@gmail.com</p>
<p></p>
<h3>0.3.1</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Minor changes</p>
<p></p>
<h3>0.3.0</h3> 
<p></p>
<p>Now the script will process a single file <b>Qs.txt</b></p>
<p></p>
<h3>0.2.1</h3>
<p></p>
<p>I jumped 0.2.0 because introduced the open answer questions in 0.1.1 version</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, finally it is one step closer to the final line :)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Minor code changes. Some windows machines when process txt in utf-8 encoding put some additional character at the beginning of the file. Since most people shouldn't use Win with AMC, I changed the code so it is suitable to Linux/Unix users :)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now all files will have the same version numbering, so that it doesn't look stupidly messy</p>
<p></p>
<h3>0.1.1 (9.1.1)</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Added feature of column number choice. Now you will need to declare the feature with <tt>'qhq'</tt> (default) and <tt>'qh4'</tt> (4 columns)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Minor improvements to the code</p>
<p></p>
<p>Multiple correct horizontal answered questions are coming in the next release</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also released the open question script - <b>open_Qs_for_AMC.py</b>. You will need to declare the number of lines and maximum mark for the question, e.g. <tt>qoLM</tt>, where L is a number of lines and M is the max points received for the all correct answer. Partial point will be calculated depending on the number of lines and max point - <pre>partialPoint = maxPoint / (numberOfLines - 1)</pre></p>
<p></p>
<h3>0.1.0 (9.1.0 for fixed 9-digit student ID number)</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Major update with the addition of <tt>qmq</tt> and <tt>qhq</tt> support</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now you will need to put all multiple correct answer questions into <b>Qms.txt</b> file utf-8 encoded, and all horizontal questions into <b>Qhs.txt</b> file utf-8 encoded</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please note that the number of columns per question (<tt>qhq</tt> ones) is defaulted to 5. Adjust according to your needs by changing this parameter in final .tex source file of AMC. In next version i will adjust it so that person could regulate it by coding <tt>qhq</tt> tag, e.g. <tt>qh2q</tt> or <tt>qh4q</tt></p>
<p></p>
<p>Also, now code is much cleaner. Fewer possible weak points</p>
<p></p>
<h3>0.0.3</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Added the check-ups for user input, which catch wrong type</p>
<p></p>
<p>Added the number of digits in student ID number, now it is forom 2 to 12</p>
<p></p>
<p>Removed some repeated codes, functions rule!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Forked the NU-specific python script (it has 9-digit student ID number by default)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Next update will be a major one, with the support for <tt>qmq</tt> and <tt>qhq</tt>!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>0.0.2</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Added date, number of copy and name managing feature. In the terminal it will ask sequentially: number of copies, the date of the exam, the name of the exam</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please, note that the date is stricted to 2099 Dec 31 max, 2020 Jan 01 min, any other dates will cause the stop and error message</p>
<p></p>
<p>Inside the prcssdQs.txt you will need to change/correct the section <b>{etu}</b>, and <b>\clearpage <=> \AMCcleardoublepage</b> depending on your needs</p>
 <p> </p>
<p>For now it prints answer sheet on a separate piece of paper, should be easier to handle scanning</p>
<p></p>
<p>There is still no python script to handle <tt>qmq</tt>. It is comming in the next version</p>
<p></p>
<h3>0.0.1</h3>
<p>The beginning of the project</p>
